# Periodic

## Rationale
I used to have a periodic-table shower curtain and I'd read it while in the bathroom.
I'd try to come up with as long a word or phrase as possible.

I like to make my own *hello-world* program in every new language I learn, and for some reason I picked this one.

## Regrets
I've had a few.
